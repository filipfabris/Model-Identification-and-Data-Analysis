# Model Identification and Data Analysis
Course held by Prof. Savaresi Sergio Matteo and prof. Formentin Simone

## Structure of the course:

### Part 1:

* Basic concepts of stochastic processes
* ARMA and ARMAX classes of parametric models for time series and for Input/Output systems
* Parameter identification of ARMA and ARMAX models
* Analysis of identification methods
* Model validation and pre-processing


### Part 2

* Non-parametric system identification: the subspace-based state-space approach
* Kalman Filter: prediction, virtual-sensing and gray-box system identification
* Analysis and design of closed-loop systems using the minimum-variance approach
* Non-linear system-identification: parametric nonlinear fitting; N-ARMAX models; optimal design of basis functions using Principal-Component-Analysis
* Frequency-domany parametric estimation of models from data
* Recursive system identification: extension of system-identification to time-varying systems
